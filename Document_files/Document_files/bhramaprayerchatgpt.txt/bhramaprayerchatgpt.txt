Great Brahma, creator of all things
The one who brought forth the universe
Your divine power knows no bounds
You are the source of all that is

In your infinite wisdom and grace
You guide us through the trials of life
Your guidance and protection, a comforting embrace
In times of turmoil and strife

You are the one who brings us peace
The one who helps us find our way
Through the darkness, you bring release
To guide us through each passing day

So let us sing your praises loud
For all the world to hear
Great Brahma, oh divine and proud
We are forever in your care.
